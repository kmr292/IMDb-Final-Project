            <p>Illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination 
              threshold varies.  It plots the true positive rating against the false positive rating.  
              The auc (area under the curve) is a number between 0 and 1, and can be used as a way 
              to compare different models.  A number closer to one represents a system that is better 
              at identifying a true positive, a number closer to 0 would be the inverse and would 
              identify a true negative as a false positive and number close to 0.5 would represent 
              an uninformative classifier.</p>

              the most time to train and test.</p>
